solve minis problem :( 
add scale free efficient step
measure sf for general ntwks 
finish open mole
connect to python after open mole for other measures and latticization
identify correct way of measuring the attractor in the presence of noise, or number of steps, etc. stop condition. For example, random network with high p, shows long periods of maxis and long periods of conformists in majority, but it keeps oscilating. How to measures this? 


test results  
add plot of deg distribution ?
add betweenness plot per type on NL interface 


*finally fix problem with distributions on lattice? 
Problem w Minis distribution:
size of error bars is not similar to davids plot, mine look bigger. 
Also, in proportion plots, minis look inversely related to conformists.and this doesnâ€™t seem to happen with maxis, why?
tightness of conditions "strictly be in majority (minority)" or "strictly have greater (smaller) payoffs than"  


*Replacement:
with replacement, New turtles are initialised with inicoop value probability. You can see how new generations initialisation can change overall cooperation, but not satisfaction or proportions greatly. Interesting idea on effects of new generations setup. 
Also can test init on certain rules: "all are born x type" or "all are born what the majority of neighbours establish" etc


2nd measure SW property will connect to python for better algorithm

add connection to python (create script) for other measures and toolbox
add other measures of network to code or python library 
python library igraph
brain connectivity toolbox also in python: modularity and community detection. shortcuts. assortatitivy. neighborhood overlap. participation coefficient. flow coefficient. latticization procedure for SW testing.
